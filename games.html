                <dt><b>Description</b></dt>
                <dd>Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is the sequel to Hotline Miami with very similar gameplay and also the final game in the series. The story is tied directly to the first game and is set between 1985 and 1991, but with an anachronistic order. While the first game offered only two playable characters with each one tied to specific parts of the game, the sequel offers a larger playable cast. Each level offers a single character or a small selection to choose from and each character offers a distinct perspective of the events. The character selection is similar to the use of masks in the first game. Each character has a specific set of abilities and perks, such as a faster speed, the ability to dodge roll, dual weapons, melee weapons only, Alex and Ash Davis as twins who use a chainsaw and guns and one is invincible as long as the other is alive, faster aiming, a silenced pistol, executions with firearms etc. Some characters allow the player to choose from different skillsets or weapons. </dd>

                <dt><b>Description</b></dt>
                <dd>Lisa (often subtitled as The Painful RPG) is a side-scrolling JRPG. It has 2D sprite graphics which bear a clear influence from the Mother series' visual style. It also shares its inspiration's absurdist sense of humor, featuring outlandish characters and settings, and also a penchant for adult themes. However, Lisa is much more straightforward about it, with plenty of unveiled violence and abuse.</dd>
